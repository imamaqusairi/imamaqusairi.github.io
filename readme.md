Predicting customer churning event of a E-Commerce company. The data cleaned from outliers , high cardinality and highly correlated features.  Then preprocessed using standardization method and feature encoding (Label Encoding & One-hot Encoding). The models trained using Hetero Ensembling method consists of 3 best perfomer models. Final evaluation got 0.98 AUC ROC score. 


### Employee Retention
